# Gesture_vocalizer_project

Sign language is a vital mode of communication for deaf and hearing impairment peoples. Our project presents a significant communication barrier between the deaf and hearing individuals who don't understand the sign language. To bridge this gap , the project proposes a system for sign language translation. The system aims to recognise and interpret sign language gestures captured by a gloves and provide real-time translation into spoken language or written language .
